# ITECH 150 - Final Project Write-up

For the final project, you will have two options. Either create a database from scratch, or a spreadsheet. Both will present challenges and both will take some time to plan. In fact, planning is one of the most important steps in this project.

## Planning

First, you must decide what project you want to do. There are two broad categories that you will want to consider. In either case, the first part of this project will be the submission of a proposal and plan. An outline of what your project will look like and what it will include. In the case of a spreadsheet, a typed description of your workbook, how many sheets it will have, what those sheets will contain, how many charts you intend to build, and their descriptions. In the case of a database, a full description of the tables you intend to create, their fields, their relationships, and then what sorts of forms, queries, and reports you will derive from those tables.

### Spreadsheet

If you decide to build a spreadsheet, you must first decide what kind of workbook you want to create. You have a considerable amount of freedom in this decision, but here are a couple of suggestions to get you started. One of the things that you must consider, however, is that you are not allowed to use templates. You can use templates for inspiration and guidance, but the spreadsheet you create must be your own work and it must be relevant to the use-case that you would envision for it.

<dl>
    <dt>A family/event/business budget.</dt>
    <dd>Keep track of finances, bills, income, and savings.</dd>
    <dt>Fitness tracker</dt>
    <dd>Keep track of exercise, calories burned, calories consumed, and other data for keeping track of a healthy lifestyle.</dd>
    <dt>Student Gradebook</dt>
    <dd>Create a gradebook to keep track of student work, assignments, homework, and calculate grades</dd>
    <dt>Scientific Data</dt>
    <dd>You can use Excel to keep track of and analyze scientific data. For this, you may need to look somewhere to find a dataset that interests you and import it into Excel. Then you will use it to calculate some statistics, perhaps, and/or build some charts.</dd>
</dl>

This is not an exhaustive list. You can think outside the box and create any spreadsheet you like. Though I do ask that you run your ideas by me so that we can come up with a plan for how to approach it and discuss what sorts of sheets, charts, and other calculations would be useful or interesting to include in the workbook. You should discuss it with me personally in any case.

The data for your spreadsheet can come from anywhere. You can either make it up completely, or find a dataset online (I can help you look for something if you like).

### Database

In deciding to build a database, the most important step is planning. You need to have a clear idea of what the purpose and intention of your database is. So you will want to decide before you even open Access how many tables you are going to need and what their relationships are. Here are a couple of possible ideas for databases to inspire you.

<dl>
    <dt>A Recipe Database</dt>
    <dd>
        Keep track of recipes, the ingredients you need for them, and maybe where you can find those ingredients at the store, or what store has them, and what sort of category of dish the recipe is for (main course, dessert, side dish, that sort of thing). Possible tables:
        <ul>
        <li>A recipe table - list of recipes that you have</li>
        <li>Ingredient table - list of ingredients that each recipe needs</li>
        <li>Cuisine/category - List of different cuisines and/or categories each dish would belong in</li>
        </ul>
    </dd>
    <dt>A Customer Database</dt>
    <dd>
    You sell a product, you have customers, your customers sometimes buy those products. Some possible tables:
    <ul>
    <li>A customer table - Customers and some demographic info</li>
    <li>A product table - List of things that you sell, maybe including how much you have in stock</li>
    <li>An order table - A link between a customer and an item that they bought, how many of each item, and perhaps the date and time of the order</li>
    </ul>
    </dd>
    <dt>A Christmas Database</dt>
    <dd>
    You have a big family and you want to keep track of all of your Christmas recipients and the gift ideas that you have for them and the places you might purchase them. Possible tables:
    <ul>
    <li>Person Table - Person you want to buy a gift for</li>
    <li>Gift idea table - Ideas associated with each person</li>
    <li>Shop Table - Places where you might buy those gifts</li>
    </ul>
    </dd>
</dl>

With any of these ideas (or one that you create on your own), you will want to populate it with data, real or made-up. You don't need to go crazy. 10 - 20 items in each table is all you need. After you build your tables, you will want to generate forms to add new items to the tables, navigate through the data in those tables, etc. You will build queries to explore and filter that data. Finally, you will build printable or exportable reports that you can use to make the data presentable.

## Project Requirements

This project will have three submitted components

1. A document detailing your plan, including what tables, charts, sheets, and data will be included. It doesn't have to be long, but it should be specific. The more time you put into your plan, the less time you have to spend actually working on the database, because in all honesty, this should be the single most time-consuming part of the project. Indeed, after submitting your plan, you should wait for feedback on it before even starting on your actual project file.
1. A project file, either a spreadsheet file (.xlsx) or an Access database (.accdb). This will include all of the actual data and parts of the project.
1. A reflection essay. About 500 words explaining your project in its complete form, reflecting on how it came together, problems you faced, ways you might expand on it, and things you might do differently.
