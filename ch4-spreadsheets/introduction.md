# Spreadsheets

The spreadsheet's purpose is to bring order to numerical data. With a spreadsheet app like Microsoft Excel, you can take raw data that is very hard for humans to parse and create readable, engaging, and useful charts, tables, and graphs. These graphs can be imported into any other document such as a PowerPoint presentation or a Word document.

The spreadsheet is the software that earned the computer its keep. The promise of being able to speed up the processing of tabular data is what convinced many corporations in the early days of computing to spend incredible sums of money on computers that, by today's standards, were very rudimentary. The modern spreadsheet application is kind of like a programming language in itself. Even with a basic understanding of tables, tabular data, and spreadsheet software you can make data entry and processing a far easier task and even impress potential employers.
