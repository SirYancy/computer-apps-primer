# Project: Weather Data (v.2)

In this project, we have three .csv files which we will consolidate into one excel file. These files have actual data from our campus of the weather over the course of three different time periods. One is a year, one is a week, and one is a single 24-hour period.

We will use these data to create charts and interesting visualizations of weather data. If you would like to experiment with other parts of the data that the campus has available, check out the college's page on [rainwise](https://rainwise.net/weather/LLTC56633)

## Directions

1. Download the three start files:
  * [Year](http://erickuha.com/primer/excel_resources/weather/weather_2017.csv)
  * [Week](http://erickuha.com/primer/excel_resources/weather/weather_jan31-feb06.csv)
  * [Day](http://erickuha.com/primer/excel_resources/weather/weather_one_day.csv)
1. As a class, we will discuss interesting ways to chart data. The goal here is to think critically about what this data is and what it represents and what interesting data might look like.
1. We are also using a somewhat imperfect data set and we will learn ways to cope with that inside of the Excel interface.

## Requirements

1. Build at least one (1) chart with each set of data and build five (5) charts overall.
1. Have all charts collected on one sheet inside of the Excel file.
1. Each chart _must_ have an appropriate title, axes labels, and legend (if necessary). The chart must explain itself.
