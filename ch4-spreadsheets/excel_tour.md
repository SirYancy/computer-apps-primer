Microsoft Excel is a spreadsheet processing application that makes it possible to create, view, edit, and process raw data to create useful, professional, and interesting tables, charts, and diagrams.

Spreadsheets have a long history. Indeed, the spreadsheet is one of the first software paradigms developed for computers. They are based on a very old tradition of compiling data into tables so that they can be more easily referenced. The problem is, doing it by hand is tedious and error-prone. Computers are _much_ better at doing calculations than we are. So let's see what they can do.

## Excel at a Glance

    <dt>Ribbon</dt>
    <dd>The ribbon, as always, is where you'll find almost all of the tools that make Excel do its magic. Flip through the tabs and see what's there. You won't understand all of it right away, but look at every tool and see what's there and guess what they might do.</dd>
    <dt>Worksheet</dt>
    <dd>A worksheet is one Excel document. Each file can be comprised of one or more worksheets. An Excel file is called a Workbook. Typically, each sheet is devoted to one set of data, that is one or more related tables, charts, and other graphics. Knowing when you need to create a new sheet to accomodate another data set is more art than science, but you'll get a feel for it soon enough.</dd>
    <dt>Sheet Tabs</dt>
    <dd>At the bottom of the interface are the tabs that allow you to switch between sheets. The button that looks like a plus creates new sheets and you can rename a sheet by double-clicking on its tab.</dd>
    <dt>Cell</dt>
    <dd>The cell is the basic unit of a spreadsheet. Each cell can contain one piece of data which can be strings of text, numbers, dates, and even tiny charts. Each cell has an address denoted by the row and column where it's located. The currently selected cell is always highlighted by a (usually green) box. One or more cells can be selected at a time. Go ahead and try selecting a different cell or clicking and dragging to select a range of cells.</dd>
    <dt>Rows and Columns</dt>
    <dd>The horizontal rows are labeled with numbers and the vertical columns are labled with letters. Each cell is in a row and a column. Combining a row and a column creates the call's name, for example "A1". An Excel spreadsheet has an upper limit of about 16,000 columns and around a million rows. Rows and columns can be resized to accomodate larger fonts or larger pieces of data by clicking and dragging between the column or row headings.</dd>
    <dt>Name Box</dt>
    <dd>The name box shows the name of the currently selected cell. Each cell is identified by its "name" or "address" or "corrdinates" with the column letter coming first. For example, the top left cell is "A1". The cell in the third column and the 6th row would be "C6". Try selecting a range of cells. See how the name box changes.</dd>
    <dt>Formula Bar</dt>
    <dd>When you select a cell and type some data into it, that data appears inside the cell. This data will also appear in the formula bar. You can also use the formula bar to edit the contents of a cell. What's more, when you type a formula (that is, when you instruct Excel to do some math in a cell), the result appears in the cell, but the raw formula will still appear in the formula bar.</dd>
    <dt>Zoom Slider</dt>
    <dd>The zoom slider allows you to zoom in and out of a sheet so that you can see the big picture or work on just a small part of your sheet. You can accomplish the same result by holding the control key and scrolling the mouse wheel forward or backward.</dd>

This is a lot to take in. But the tutorials that follow will help to ease you into easily one of the most useful pieces of software that you will ever use. With Excel, you can build a basic household budget, analyze scientific data, or build reports for work. Not everyone will find a place for Excel in their lives and careers, but it's always better to learn the basics so that in case you _do_ need it later, you'll have it.

Let's start with some theory.
