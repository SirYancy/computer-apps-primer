# Project: Baseball Salaries

In this project, you will download a large data set that outlines the names, positions, teams, and salaries of Major League Baseball players in 2016. The file comes as a .csv, which is not actually a spreadsheet, so you will have to remember to save it as an Excel file before you do anything with it.

## Here's how:

1. Download the [start file](http://erickuha.com/primer/excel_resources/baseball.csv)
1. Open the file in Microsoft Excel. You should see the data displayed as normal.
1. Click the **File** tab and in the backstage view, click **Save As** <br> ![1][1]
1. Click **Browse**. In the *Save As* dialog, navigate to your preferred folder, and then in the *Save as type:* dropdown, select <strong>Excel Workbook (*.xlsx)</strong> <br> ![2][2]

Now that your file is saved, format the data as a table by clicking inside the data (anywhere) and pressing **Ctrl-a** on your keyboard. This selects all of the data. Use the **Format as Table** tool in the **Home** tab and you're ready to go.

You know how to create a pivot table (hint: it's in the **Insert** tab)

Create a new blank sheet called *Answers*. Use what you know about pivot tables to answer the following questions, and then enter them into the *Answers* sheet.

Your answer sheet will look something like this: <br> ![3][3]

1. Who is the highest paid player in the league?
