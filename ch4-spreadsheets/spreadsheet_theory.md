One of the most fundamental tasks of a computer is to automate tasks that, not so long ago, had to be done by hand. _The goal of a computer is to save you time and work_. Spreadsheet software is one of the most fundamental and oldest software paradigms to do this.

Consider that a long time ago, if you owned a shop or had a job, the only way you had of knowing whether you had made any money was by counting your money at the end of the day and hoping it was more than you had yesterday. Throughout history, many civilizations and enterprising people developed all sorts of ways of keeping track of numbers for various reasons. Maybe they were financial. Perhaps scientific. No matter the reason, it was all done by hand.

So in the 70s, you can imagine how many accountants, business people, family budget balancers, and scientists were pretty eager to find out just how these new computing machines could help them simplify the process of keeping track of numbers. And indeed, this was one of the places where the earliest computers truly shined.

If I pull out my smartphone and check the weather, I will have a pretty good idea about whether I need to wear a coat or bring an umbrella. 

But, if I were to list the outside temperature at my home hour by hour, day after day, year after year, somehow, I should be able to use that data to predict whether I should wear a coat on a particular day of the year. However, if I just handed you a list of dates, times, and temperatures, it actually wouldn't mean that much to you. That's because it's just <strong>raw data</strong>. You could read down the list and maybe find out what the temperature was on your birthday, but other than that, you can't really learn anything from this list of temperatures.

So we need to find a way to process that raw data into useful <strong>information</strong> and maybe we can learn something deeper. Converting that data into a line graph, for instance, might give you an interesting visual idea of the temperature changes throughout the day. Or the year. Perhaps I can go a step futher and learn something about yearlong trends in temperature in my region. Perhaps I can include data points about rainfall and see if there's a relationship between temperature and rain. Maybe you could take thirty or even a hundred years of temperature data to determine the effects of climate change in my region.

Spreadsheet software does all of this and more. We are going to start relatively simple, but our goal in this course is a deep enough understanding of the sofware to do things like keep track of your finances, build a budget, and even build a business plan or scientific data analysis.
