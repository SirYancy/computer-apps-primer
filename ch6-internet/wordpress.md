# WordPress

WordPress is really two things. It is a web service that offers free hosting for weblogs and other web sites. It is also the software behind that service which is also available for free and is open-source.

We are going to build a basic weblog using Wordpress. A little background, first.

## What is a weblog?

A weblog, or blog, is a website built around chronologically published, diary-style entires called "posts". They are usually displayed in reverse chronological order (the most recent at the top). They are usually dedicated to a single topic, though this is not always the case. Often companies (especially tech companies) will host a blog to deliver news about the sorts of things they've been up to recently. Many blogs are written and maintained by individuals as diaries or journals, though this use-case has largely been eclipsed by large-scale social media sites like Facebook and Twitter, though some blogging platforms continue to be popular, such as [blogger](https://www.blogger.com), [WordPress](https://www.wordpress.com/), and [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/).

That said, while the popularity of personal blogs has been in decline, many news outlets and other businesses still hire bloggers as media commentators or to deliver internal news in an informal way. Some of the most successful and popular blogs are ones dedicated to very focused topics such as cooking, tech support, woodworking, and that sort of thing. Most modern blogging software are actually website backends in themselves. That is, they can be repurposed from chronological journaling to being a full-fledged web site.

## What is WordPress?

WordPress is one of the single most popular website backends that has ever been built. It was originally conceived as exclusively blogging software, however, it now has built-in tools for creating static websites and even an e-commerce platform. It's kind of the "do everything" web software. This makes it enormously flexible and powerful. It's simple, intuitive interface gives it a distinct advantage over coding everything by hand and its customizability allow the user a lot more freedom that simpler web hosting services like Wix or Weebly.

WordPress is a very big piece of software though, and as such it does suffer from some problems with performance and speed, but on modern hardware this is hardly noticeable.

# TUTORIAL - Build a WordPress Site

We are going to build a WordPress site. The service is free, so you don't have to worry about that. It really does only take a few minutes. So let's get started

## Setting up an account

1. Go to [WordPress.com](https://wordpress.com/)
1. The site is highly intuitive. In the top-right corner, click the **Get Started** link <br> ![1][1]
1. The first thing it will ask is what type of site you want to create. Make a mental note of the options available and then select **Start with a blog**. <br> ![2][2]
1. On the next page, you will select a theme. Choose whichever you like.
1. We'll assume you don't already own a domain (though they are not expensive). So, type in some words that describe the blog that you want to create and it will help you generate a unique address for your blog. When it generates some possible URLs for you, select one of the free options. <br> ![3][3]
1. The next page will ask you to select a plan. Choose the free plan.
1. The final screen will ask you to set up an account which your weblog will be attached to. Use an email address, give yourself a username, and choose a secure password.
1. A few moments will go by after you do this and then you will be given the option to view your site.

## Customize your blog

You're going to want to change a few things like the fact that the title of your blog is currently "My Site". So,

1. Click on the **My Sites** button on the top left corner of the screen. Scroll down to the bottom of the sidebar and click on **Settings**.<br> ![6][6]
1. Take a few minutes to make any adjustments to the site's settings. And while you're at it, scroll through and look at _all_ of the settings that are available, because there are a lot. For example, you can make your site hidden or private (read my disclaimer about this below).

## Delete the dummy post and write your own.

The blog will be created with a post already published. We'll delete that and then write our own first blog post.

1. You will first be greeted with a view of your web site. There should be some filler text and stuff that we are going to change. First, scroll around and see what's all here. At the top of the screen will be a menu bar (only when you're logged in). Click the **My Sites** link. It will open a sidebar with a bunch of options. Then, click the **Blog Posts** button to edit blog posts.<br> ![4][4]
1. You will see the "First blog post" is the only one here. Click the **More** button under it and click **Trash** to delete it. <br> ![5][5]
1. Now, to create your _real_ first blog post, click the **Write** button at the top-right of the screen. You will be greeted with a rich text editor with loads of formatting options.
1. Give your post a title and you can write whatever you want about whatever you want and it will be published on the internet for anyone and everyone to read.

## Some thoughts on privacy

<div class="alert alert-info">
Try to be privacy minded. Some people are very public about who they are on the internet. Other people, not so much. For the purposes of this class, you might choose to use an alias, keep yourself out of it. After all, this is a college assignment and the posts you write will be within certain parameters. Still, a blog is a public document and I encourage you to keep your blog open and even allow it to be indexed. After all, that's kind of the point. But, if you're still not comfortable with your blog being public, let me know and I will show you how to keep it private and add me as a reader so that I can at least see what you post.

## Your first real blog post

For your first blog post, introduce yourself. I know it sounds cheesy, but it's also a good way to introduce a blog. If you want to be anonymous, you can introduce yourself by some pseudonym or nickname; lots of poeple do this. So for this post (about a paragraph), include at least *some* of the following information:

* Who you are and what you do
* If you have an idea for a blog, include the purpose of this blog is (aside from just being a school assignment)
* If not, then just talk a little bit about yourself and why you are studying computing and what you hope to gain from the course.
* Feel free to be funny, creative, clever. I don't mind if you make jokes about this just being for school.

When you are finished with the post (about a paragraph), publish it. Your last task will be to submit the URL for your blog to the class portal. Navigate to your blog and select the URL in the browser bar. Copy this into the first post blogging assignment on course portal and submit.

And with that, you're done!
