# Create a Web Site

Building a website in the modern digital age is potentially quite easy. However, there are some pitfalls and challenges that must be overcome in order to make a website that is attractive to look at and worthwhile to visit.

In this project, you will be building a web site from scratch using a powerful, long-established web software suite called [Wordpress](https://wordpress.com/).

You may also use [Createspace](https://www.squarespace.com/).

Once you have an idea for a Web site, the first thing that you must do is decide on what software to use and they all have their strengths and weaknesses. You have essentially four options:

1. Pay someone else to do it.
2. Use a site-generator or simple WYSIWYG editor \(Weebly, Google Pages\)
3. Code it all up from scratch
4. Some combination the above three.

We are going to use Wordpress for the simple fact that it is an appropriate middle-ground between all of these and using Wordpresses hosting platform, we can also see the fruits of our labors in a live web site which is totally out there for everyone to see.

## Your task

Decide on a topic for a web page. For this assignment, I'm giving you total control. It can be as fictional or as true as you like, and it can be just about any topic that you find interesting. Some suggestions, though:

* A family web site introducing the web to everyone, the kids, their hobbies and interests, and the your own.
* A business page advertising a business, showcasing examples of its work, and being a location for contact information.
* A hobby page. That is, a web page to showcase your own hobby and examples of it. You can even include tutorials about how to do things
  * Cooking
  * Modeling
  * Traveling
  * Video Games
* A political campaign web site where you show off a candidate to the world, describe their platform and politics, and get that message out there.

Your web site must have the following

* It must be built with WordPress.
* It must include at least 3 pages.
* It must have images on all pages.
* It must use some sort of navigation bar to move around.
* It must at least pretend to be serious \(even if it's kind of a comedy site\). That is, no low-effort submissions. Make it look like you care.

Submit the URL to your site to course portal on Canvas.
