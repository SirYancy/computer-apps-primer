In order to really "get" relational databases and the tools that you can use to interact with them, you really do need to build your own. To that end, you will build a database from scratch and then populate it with your own data \(real or fictional\).  This project will be divided into three parts.

## Part 1 - Build your tables

Here you will build a database with at least three tables and two relationships between them. Here are a few ideas \(you may use these or some other idea if you wish\) and possible tables that you might build:

* **A Recipe Database** - Keeping track of recipes, the ingredients you need for them, and where you can find those ingredients in the grocery store.
  * A Recipe table - List of recipes that you have
  * Ingredient table - Ingredients that each recipe needs
  * Area table - Which section of the grocery store each ingredient can be purchased
* **A Customer Database** - You sell some products, you have customers, your customers sometimes buy those products
  * A Customer table - customers and their demographic info
  * A Product table - These are all of the things you sell
  * An Order table - This is going to link a customer to an item that they bought and how many \(You might use a calculated field here\)
* **A Christmas Database** - You want to keep track of all of your Christmas recipients and and the gift ideas you have for them and the places you might go to purchase them.
  * Person table - people you wish to buy gifts for
  * Gift Idea table - ideas associated with each person
  * Shop table - places where you might buy those gifts

Add at least **5 records** to each table.

Complete **Part 1** and submit before moving on to **Part 2**

## Part 2 - Build Queries

No database is even slightly useful without a couple of queries. The guidance I can offer here is somewhat limited as you may have built any kind of database that one can think of. So, some general advice:

* When brainstorming queries, think about the sorts of things you might want to know about your database.
* You can query any table you like. Even a one-table query might yield interesting results if it filtered the table creatively. For example, query your Christmas List for all for all of the gifts that can be bought on Amazon.
* At least **one query** must pull data from **two or more tables**.
* You must create at least **3 queries**.

Come see me or email me if you have any questions at all.

## Part 3 - Build Reports

In order to make something legible, readable, and printable, reports are necessary. For this assignment, you will create some reports based on the database that you have built in the previous two parts.

* Build 3 reports.
* They can be pulled from your queries or your tables or both.
* They must "make sense." That is, you should have a good rationale for why _this_ report would be necessary to pull.
* You will be graded based on apprpriateness of your reports to your dataset, tables, and queries. You will also be scored a little bit on formatting and legibility.
* Ask the instructor if there's anything you need clarified or if you get stuck.

Complete **Part 3** and submit before moving on to **Part 4**.

## Part 4 - Forms

Last, but certainly not least, you will need to give your users some sort of interface with which to interact with your database. So you will need to build some forms. Think carefully about what information your database is storing and how you might be adding it. How should it work?

* Build 2 forms.
* At least one of the forms must involve more than one table.
* If you are confused, do not hesitate to look back over the [form tutorial].
* If you are still confused, try Google or ask the instructor for help.

That's it. Upload the final version of your project.
