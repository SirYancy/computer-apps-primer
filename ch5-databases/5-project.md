In order to really "get" relational databases and the tools that you can use to interact with them, you really do need to build your own. To that end, you will build a database from scratch and then populate it with your own data (real or fictional).  This project will be divided into three parts.

## Part 1 - Build your tables
Here you will build a database with at least three tables and two relationships between them. Here are a few ideas (you may use these or some other idea if you wish) and possible tables that you might build:

* A Recipe Database - Keeping track of recipes, the ingredients you need for them, and where you can find those ingredients in the grocery store.
    * A Recipe table - List of recipes that you have
    * Ingredient table - Ingredients that each recipe needs
    * Area table - Which section of the grocery store each ingredient can be purchased
* A Customer Database - You sell some products, you have customers, your customers sometimes buy those products
    * A Customer table - customers and their demographic info
    * A Product table - These are all of the things you sell
    * An Order table - This is going to link a customer to an item that they bought and how many (You might use a calculated field here)
* A Christmas Database - You want to keep track of all of your Christmas recipients and
    * Person table - people you wish to buy gifts for
    * Gift Idea table - ideas associated with each person
    * Shop table - places where you might buy those gifts

Complete **Part 1** and submit before moving on to **Part 2**
