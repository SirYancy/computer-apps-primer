# Databases

A database is a collection of data. Good database software allows the user to add data, access it, and analyze that data and will have many built-in tools to make this quick and easy. They are perhaps the single most important piece of software that a computer possesses and most people are completely unaware of them.

For this course, we will focus on [Microsoft Access](https://products.office.com/en-us/access), because it comes with a relatively easy-to-use built-in interface, but there are many, many other options out there of varying levels of complexity.
