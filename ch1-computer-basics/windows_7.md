# Windows 7 - The Grand Tour

Microsoft Windows 7 is the operating system that we will use in our examples throughout this text. While there have been three new versions of Windows since 7's debut (8, 8.1, and 10), we will use Windows 7 for three very good reasons. One, adoption of operating systems is a slow process and Windows 7 continues to be the primary operating system used by most companies. Two, it is the operating system that we use on all of the comptuers at the Leech Lake Tribal College Campus (though and upgrade to Windows 10 is in the works sometime in the next couple years). And three, when the time does come to upgrade to a newer operating system, while there are some distinct interface changes, they are pretty easy to adapt to and the vast majority of the interface features that we will explore in this class will remain essentially unchanged.
