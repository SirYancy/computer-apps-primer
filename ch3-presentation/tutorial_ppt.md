# PowerPoint Basics

As was mentioned in tour, presentation software is a supplement to a public speaking event, speech, or other information delivery mechanism. It's often used as a means in itself, but on some level, it is almost always accompanied by a publicly delivered speech at some point. Perhaps the slides from the presentation are then made available for people who attended the lecture to refresh their memories. So, always keep in mind that the slideshow is not the primary information delivery method and should always be regarded as a supplement to a more comprehensive performance.

## Some rules to keep in mind

You're going to spend some time learning the basic tools that PowerPoint has to offer. Graphic design is outside the purview of this course, but there are a few rules that can be addressed at this point that might help you to make some more professional-looking, impactful slide shows.

* **PowerPoint is not your presentation.** Do not let the software dominate the presentation. You are not here to show off your skills with presentation software; you are here to convince, inform, or educate.
* **Keep it Simple.** There are a number of ways you can execute this. For example, try to follow the 5/5/5 rule which states: no more than 5 words per line of text, five lines of text per slide, or five text-heave slides in a row. Other "rules" that are often put forward are things like "no more than 15 slides". Or the "no more than 14 words on a slide" rule. No matter how you formulate it, the gist is that you should limit the information on a slide to succinct bullet points and fill in all of the details with your speech. Think of the slideshow as an accent to the information that you already have memorized.
* **Practice your speech.** Practice, practice, practice. You should have your presentation essentially memorized before delivering it. Otherwise, you run the risk of simply reading the slides in an awkward, monotone way. And that can be a little dull.
* **Don't write in complete sentences.** Your bullets should be headlines. Use sentence fragments. Save the complete sentences for the speech.
* **Don't go too crazy with animations and transitions.** Again, your PowerPoint skills are only ever going to be on trial in *this* class. Never again. No one else wants to see the cool animation you found, the funny background music, or the 12 minute YouTube video that you embedded in a slide (that probably won't work anyway because the internet doesn't work for some reason). Animations and transitions are nice, but only when they are not a distraction or worse, an annoyance.

This list could go on infinitum, however, I believe the takeaway is pretty clear. Simplicity is best and a slide show is nothing more than a visual aid and never the end in itself (except, of course, for this one section of this class).
